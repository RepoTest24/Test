# Telecom Churn Analysis



## Introduction  

This project analyzes telecom billing data to identify customer churn patterns by tracking daily activations and deactivations, including reasons for leaving. Using Python, Pandas, and NumPy, it handles messy data to extract actionable insights for reducing churn.



## End Goal  
- Analyze daily churn trends and deactivation reasons  
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Identify key churn drivers  
- Prepare groundwork for predictive churn modeling  
## How to Use  
### Prerequisites  
 Python 3.x  
 Pandas, NumPy  
 Matplotlib or Seaborn (optional for visualization)  
 
- Install dependencies with:
 > pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
## Running the Project
- Clone the repo:



> git clone https://github.com/BharadwajKavya18/telecom-churn-analysis.git

> cd telecom-churn-analysis





- Add your dataset telecom\_billing\_churn\_messy.csv to the folder.



- Run the analysis script or notebook:



> python churn_analysis.py

---or open/create churn_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter---



- Check the generated outputs and visualizations.
